<h3> Sprint Completed Stories</h3>
<ul>
<li>Project Status Report</li>
<li>Upload app on hosting platform</li>
	
</ul>
<p>We worked on the new user story creation, and updated project status report to complete sprint 2. We created more user stories, milestones and project dashboard in github. We also conducted a product backlog grooming session. We spent considerable time to understand starter code and made some changes to it using branches. We uploaded the starter code on the heroku app. We faced challenges in creating rsvp form and dynamically changing pictures associated with events. The key lesson from the challenges was to seek help from Kyle to understand the errors we made. </p>
